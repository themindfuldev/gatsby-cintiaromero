  A fully-responsive website that focus on the core pages (Homepage, Category,
  Product and Choose your kit) to drive more sales. It elevates the brand image,
  with an elegant and mobile-friendly facelift. My role was to research, test
  and redesign all the UIs related to the project. I collaborated with project
  management, product development and design to launch this first step of the

<a id="the-problem-definition"></a>
## The problem definition 

**Dealing with online direct sales should be simple and fun. How to do demonstrate it through a website?**

<a href="https://www.rubyribbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby Ribbon</a> is a Silicon Valley-based apparel company known for selling shapewear and fashion through Independent Stylists, as a direct sales business.

My first priority was to make Ruby Ribbon's website responsive and more accessible, and of course applying contemporary e-commerce features. 

The foundation for this project was based in user research and tests.

<a id="the-user-research"></a>
## The user research

**Real clients/stylists, fashionistas and potential clients.**

I started with a survey and applied it to 18 people (including current clients/stylists, employees, potential clients/stylists and fashionistas) to better understand the experience they have while accessing Ruby Ribbon’s website.

Facts I comproved:

**A) Not a mobile-friendly website**

95% of the interviewed complained about features not working on mobile platforms.

**B) Poor e-commerce structure**

90% of the interviewed didn't like the structure of the website. They think it’s difficult to buy and find products on the website. 

I also performed an observation test including 10 different profiles (current clients/stylists, employees, potential clients/stylists and fashionistas) to understand their behavior while going through Ruby Ribbon’s website. 

Facts I discovered:

**A) Outdated visual**

89% of the users thought the website didn't match with the products the brand sell, since the main products have high technology on the garments/shapes.

**B) Complicated flow**

94% of the users took a long time to find the product they wanted and as well as finding correctly the prices and sizes available.

**C) Missing information (and opportunities) about the products**

89% of the users wanted to see information about the garments, technology and reviews about the products. 90% of the users asked for related products and suggestions to buy.

## The design solution

**A responsive and fashionable website, easy to find and buy products.**

The goal of the project is to drive more clients and sales through the website, creating a responsive layout, adjustable to multiple platforms.

<a id="the-design-process"></a>
## The design process

- **Content**: Cleaned the menu, deleted a few non-essential pages and adding others.
- **Layout**: A fashionable and elegant design, matching with the brand concept and technology.
- **E-commerce**: Revamped the PDP pages, added simple e-commerce features, resulting in a better shopping experience.

## Reflection 

I was surprised to see how many users had struggles accessing the website through smartphones and tablets. So we focused on mobile-first concept, making the content suitable for multiple platforms. 
The tests were successful, now the company is ready for the next phase of the project.

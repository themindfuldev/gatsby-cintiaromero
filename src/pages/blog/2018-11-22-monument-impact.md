## The problem definition 

A non-profit organization has many challenges. One of the most important tasks is to gain visibility and trust, so the organization can join funds to develop projects benefiting the community. As every non-profit organization, Monument Impact needs more donations. **How to increase the amount of donors through Monument Impact’s website?**

The foundation of this project based on researches and in case studies, focusing in User Interface and in a mobile first concept to increase the number of access, attracting more donors to the cause. 

My first priority was to make it possible for the users to find specific information on the website in an easier way, in multiple platforms. 


<a id="the-user-research"></a>
## The user research

Students, employees, and potential students and donors. 

I did researches through surveys with quantitative and qualitative questions. The surveys had two versions, English and Spanish.  

I also performed interviews and dynamics groups with employees to collect and observe expectations about the redesign.

### General results from the surveys

- A) 92% of the users go to the website to check  news and updates about classes and events.
- B) 86% of the users access the website every couple weeks. 
- C) 43% of the users uses smartphone to access Monument Impact website.
- D) 78% of the access comes from students. 
- E) 81% of the users are latinos and Spanish is their primary language.

## The design solution

Concepts to solve the problem:

- Create a more appealing modern visual, showing all the great work Monument Impact does, attracting donors. 
- Make the Donate CTA pops-up, to capture more supporters. 
- Insert a translation plugin, giving Spanish option for the users. 
- Develop a mobile friendly interface for multiple platforms.
- Work on the contrast, making the website more accessible.

## The low-fidelity wireframes

I prefer starting out with low-fidelity wireframes to think through the structure of the page. I used Adobe XD to iterate during the design process.

## The high-fidelity designs

After distilling the research, I created high-fidelity wireframes using Adobe XD to iterate design options quickly. Working with my project lead, we used the wireframes to discuss product strategy.

## Reflection 

This project was such a great experience for me. I loved diving more into Wordpress templates and features, customizing and creating a whole redesign. All the researches and interviews helped me to apply usability in my designs, and it felt good to develop a clean and responsive interface, with the confidence that users will be surprised in a good way by it.

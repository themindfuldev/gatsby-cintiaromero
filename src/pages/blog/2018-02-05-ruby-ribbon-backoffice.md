  A functional platform that helps stylists to organize Trunk Shows and
  facilitates the sales. It removes pain of closing online sales with an
  intuitive and clean interface. My role was to research, test and redesign all
  the UIs related to the project. I collaborated with project management,
  product development and design to launch this first step of the project.

<a id="the-problem-definition"></a>
## The problem definition 

**Finding resources and closing sales should be fun and simple. How to make the Stylist experience more pleasant?**

<a href="https://www.rubyribbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby Ribbon</a> is a Silicon Valley-based apparel company known for selling shapewear and fashion through Independent Stylists, as a direct sales business.

My first priority was to make Ruby Ribbon's portal responsive and easy to navigate, creating a functional and clean design. 

The foundation for this project was based in user research and tests. 

<a id="the-user-research"></a>
## The user research

**Stylists, employees and potential stylists.**

The priority was to delivery a brand new portal for stylists, organizing the content and cleaning-up the layout. 

I performed an observation test with 12 persons (including current stylists, employees, potential stylists), going through to each page of the Back Office.

Relevant facts I discovered: 

**A) Not mobile-friendly**

95% of the users wanted to be able to close sales and find resources in multiple platforms.

**B) Confused homepage**

89% of the users thought the current Back Office portal was hard to be figured out. People got lost on the Homepage.

**C) Complicated flow**

- 63% of the users didn’t find resources they wanted without customer support help. 
- 78% complained about way too many clicks to close a sale through the Back Office environment.

**D) Not an attractive layout**

87% of the users didn’t like the look of the Back Office, they thought it should be cleaner and more visually appealing.

<a id="the-design-solution"></a>
## The design solution

**A responsive and simple yet effective portal.**

The goal of the project is to provide a clean and organized structure, easy to find resources and empower the stylists to close more sales.

<a id="the-design-process"></a>
## The design process

- **Content**: Redid the menu flow, removed old resources and made it more functional and organized.
- **Layout**: Focused on the Homepage. Provided a clean layout, matching with the new website concept. Added iconography.
- **Stylist experience**: Made it simple to navigate and to find/share resources.

## Reflection 
As same as the website, I was surprised to see how many stylists had struggles organizing sales through smartphones and tablets. So we focused on mobile-first concept, making it easier to navigate and creating a very intuitive feeling.

## The problem definition 

**Finding resources and closing sales should be fun and simple. How to make the Stylist experience more pleasant?**

[Ruby Ribbon](https://www.rubyribbon.com/), is a Silicon Valley-based apparel company known for selling shapewear and fashion through Independent Stylists, as a direct sales business.

My first priority was to make Ruby Ribbon's portal responsive and easy to navigate, creating a functional and clean design. 

The foundation for this project was based in user research and tests. 

<a id="the-user-research"></a>
## The user research

**Stylists, employees and potential stylists.**

The priority was to delivery a brand new portal for stylists, organizing the content and cleaning-up the layout. 

I performed an observation test with 12 persons (including current stylists, employees, potential stylists), going through to each page of the Back Office.

Relevant facts I discovered: 

**A) Not mobile-friendly**

95% of the users wanted to be able to close sales and find resources in multiple platforms.

**B) Confused homepage**

89% of the users thought the current Back Office portal was hard to be figured out. People got lost on the Homepage.

**C) Complicated flow**

- 63% of the users didn’t find resources they wanted without customer support help. 
- 78% complained about way too many clicks to close a sale through the Back Office environment.

**D) Not an attractive layout**

87% of the users didn’t like the look of the Back Office, they thought it should be cleaner and more visually appealing.

## The design solution

**A responsive and simple yet effective portal.**

The goal of the project is to provide a clean and organized structure, easy to find resources and empower the stylists to close more sales.

<a id="the-design-process"></a>
## The design process

- **Content**: Redid the menu flow, removed old resources and made it more functional and organized.
- **Layout**: Focused on the Homepage. Provided a clean layout, matching with the new website concept. Added iconography.
- **Stylist experience**: Made it simple to navigate and to find/share resources.

## Reflection 

A responsive e-commerce experience is essential for a fashion start-up. Nowadays, people buy products through multiple platforms. 

The proposal of the Back Office was fun to work with, but for the future, I would love to create an app as well, so the clients/stylists can better interact with the brand.

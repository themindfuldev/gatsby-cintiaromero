## The problem definition 

**Dealing with digital agencies should be simple, pleasant and innovative. How to demonstrate that, showing its identity in a better way?**

<a href="http://artemia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artemia</a> is a full-service agency with expertise in Digital Marketing and Strategic Communication. It provides B2B and B2C and it's based in San Francisco, CA.

The foundation for this project is based in user researches and case studies.

My first priority was to make Artemia's website responsive, elegant and more interesting.

## The user research

**Real clients and potential clients.**

I started with a survey and applied it to 13 people (including current clients, employees, and potential clients).

Goal: to discover the struggles while accessing Artemia’s website and the expectations they have when navigating through it. 

Here are the main topics I got from the survey: 

**A) Not a mobile-friendly website**

91% of the interviewed got frustrated about not having a mobile-friendly website.

**B) Old-school visual**

95% of the interviewed didn't like the current design of the website. 

**C) Disorganized structure**

87% of the users had struggles trying to find information about the company.

## The design solution

**A responsive and clean website, offering an innovative and elegant concept, matching with the agency identity (located in a heart of a high-tech city).**

<a id="the-design-process"></a>
## The design process

- **Content**: Working with the team, dividing the website by content, making it easier to navigate and to find topics. 
- **Creating a new layout**: Showing an innovative design, responsive, clean and elegant. Ideal to access in multiple platforms.

## Reflection 

A responsive website layout is a must-have for a digital service agency. Up-to-date is the key to show an agency located in the heart of a high-tech city.

The proposal of Artemia’s new website was fun to create, but for the future I would love to go deeper, creating a working prototype and applying A/B tests.
